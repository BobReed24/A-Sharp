## Current Stage
- A-Sharp is in the very early development stages with algorithim methods the main focus.
- The running directly on desktop feature is being worked on subtly.
- Current benchmark tests show a 130% performance boost with the what might be the recommended specs.
- 3D Mark will be used for testing and multiple games.
- Current avg fps shows 124 fps without A-Sharp enabled.
- Current avg fps shows 285 fps with A-Sharp enabled.
## Disclamer
- No A-Sharp is NOT fake in fact all current tests are REAL. No hypotheticals as it may seem these are just hypotheticals
- A Caseohplex is 10 * 10^10000000000^1000000000^100000000^10000000^1000000^100000^10000^100^10
