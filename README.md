# A-Sharp (Adaptive Sharpening)

A-Sharp is an advanced upscaling technology still in development, designed to enhance gaming and application performance by leveraging both local system resources (RAM, CPU) and cloud-based AI processing. It’s built to deliver real-time performance improvements and higher visual fidelity without requiring specific app or game support. A-Sharp will operate directly on the desktop, offering users a simple, plug-and-play solution for optimized graphics.

## Development Timeline

- **Open Alpha**: Early 2025
- **Open Beta**: Late 2025
- **Full Release (v1.0.0)**: Mid 2026

A-Sharp’s main goal is to provide a broad performance improvement across many use cases, working seamlessly on both gaming PCs and workstations.

## Key Features

- **Performance Boost**: A-Sharp aims to deliver significant performance gains, with a **75% boost** on minimum specs and up to **145%** on recommended hardware, optimizing resource usage without sacrificing quality.
- **Frame Generation**: A-Sharp integrates a frame generation feature that reduces the visual load, allowing for smoother, higher frame rates, with minimal input delay—maintaining responsiveness and user control.
- **Hardware Compatibility**: While A-Sharp is optimized for **GTX** cards, it will also be compatible with **RTX** cards. It’s designed to be accessible for a wide range of graphics hardware, including older GTX models.
- **Compact and Efficient**: The A-Sharp software is designed to be lightweight, with an expected installation size of approximately **4GB**, making it easy to deploy without overburdening system resources.

## System Requirements

### Minimum System Requirements
- **DirectX 12/11**
- **CUDA Toolkit 12.6** (Specific version to be finalized by 1/4/2025)
- **Hardware details** to be announced by **1/4/2025**

### Recommended System Requirements
- **DirectX 12/11**
- **CUDA Toolkit 12.6** (Final version)
- **Hardware specifications** will be disclosed by **1/4/2025**

## Current Development Stage

A-Sharp is currently in its early stages, with the core AI algorithms being refined. Early benchmarks have shown up to **130% improvement** in performance with configurations that might align with the recommended specs. Testing is underway using industry-standard benchmarking tools, like **3DMark**, and a variety of game titles to validate performance.

Preliminary testing results indicate that users experience an average of **124 fps** without A-Sharp enabled, which increases to **285 fps** when the upscaling is active, depending on the game and system configuration.
